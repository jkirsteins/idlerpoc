- Consult README for project scope before starting work.
- Always consider WORLDRULES.md for our game world constraints. Apply these to any game design decisions.
- Update README to reflect project goals/scope before commits.
- README: high-level only. Infer architecture from code; detailed docs go in docs/.
- Commit messages: concise, no "Claude Code" mentions.
- Never implement any migration code unless asked. For a proof of concept we should just reset the game state when making incompatible changes.
- "tick" is a implementation term, and should not appear in the game UI ever. Instead of "tick" convert it to terms like days, months, years, etc.
- Maintain BACKLOG.md: add deferred ideas during design discussions, remove items when implemented.

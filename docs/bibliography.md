## Reference Games by Training Model

### Coupled ("Learn by Doing")

Games where skills improve by performing associated activities.

- **RuneScape** — Mine ore to train Mining, cook food to train Cooking. Classic coupled skill system.
- **Melvor Idle** — Idle variant of the RuneScape model. Skills 1-99 follow a curve where the last 8 levels (92-99) take as long as levels 1-92 combined. Full completion: ~3,000+ hours.
- **Skyrim** — Skills improve through use. Heavy Armor levels up by taking hits while wearing heavy armor.
- **Idle Skilling** — Idle game with skill-by-doing progression.

### Decoupled ("Passive Queue / Time-Based")

Games where skills train via a real-time queue independent of gameplay activities.

- **EVE Online** — Pure time-based skill queue. CCP identified skill training as "one of the big roadblocks preventing new player retention." CCP also acknowledged "people were a lot more patient 22 years ago." EVE earned the nickname "Skill Queue Online" because many players' primary interaction was checking their queue.
- **OGame** — Time-based research and building queues.
- **Torn City** — Real-time stat training independent of gameplay.

### Hybrid (Both)

Games combining activity-based and point/queue-based progression.

- **Starfield** — Skill points from leveling + usage challenges to unlock ranks.
- **Fable** — Typed XP from combat styles + general XP pool for allocation.
- **Idling to Rule the Gods** — Passive queue + clone automation for skill training.
- **Star Wars Combine** — 42 skill points allocated at creation (front-loaded), then XP from activities → level up → 1 freely allocatable point. System is heavily front-loaded; ongoing level-up gains are marginal compared to initial allocation.

## Idle Game Industry Data

### Session Patterns

- Average idle game session: ~8 minutes
- Average check-ins per day: 5.3
- Total daily engagement: ~42 minutes

### Retention Benchmarks

- Day 1 retention (top 25%): 42%
- Day 7: 10-15%
- Day 28: 5-10%
- 80% of mobile players abandon within the first week

### Engagement Decay Principle

Ideal pacing matches the player's natural attention curve. Multiple resource systems should operate at different time scales:

- Clock A caps every ~20 minutes (short check-in reward)
- Clock B caps every ~5 hours (lunch/dinner check-in)
- Clock C caps every ~2 days (weekly planning layer)

### What Kills Retention

1. Hitting a wall with no visible path forward
2. Punishing absence (losing progress while away)
3. Tedious mechanics that feel like wasted time
4. Number novelty wearing off without new systems to discover

### What Sustains Retention Over Months

1. Multiple interacting systems requiring strategic rebalancing
2. New mechanics "unfolding" over time (not just bigger numbers)
3. Offline progress creating anticipation to return
4. Always having a visible "next goal" within reach
